I don't really know what this is yet, I'm going to start with a web server and
some WebSockets and the basis of an idea. Then I'm going to get some scorpion
bowls, and hope the Ballmer Peak does the rest.

## Follow up

Totally missed the Ballmer Peak, was conviced code should have been in English
and not Go, got frustrated and passed out on couch. 

## Update

Ate lots of greasy breakfast foods, hangover successfully quelled. I think I've
written code things, but I have no guarantee that anything does literally
anything at all.

## Day 7

Ideas are starting to flow, pages are starting to form, morale is at an
all-time high. Bathroom break imminent, caffeine likely to blame.

## Unholy things are happening

You know it's bad when you've resorted to turing a Javascript algorithm into
Go, gross. Also I have no idea what I'm doing, how do I image?

## Back on Track

After hours of flopping around like an electricuted fish out of water in an
earthquake, thrashing like a system with 1 MB of RAM trying to load Unity, I've
finally oriented myself and put together something that kind of works. Current
functionality is ability to upload images, functional image placement
algorithm, functional thumbnails and other little things. Next steps include
magical things like WebSocket updates of the page, smarter collage scaling,
functional URLs, and div clickbox mapping with ImageJSON method. But first, a
meeting with some clients. I'm definitely going to be cutting this too close
for comfort, but I wouldn't really be comfortable with anything else.
