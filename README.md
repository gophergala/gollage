I don't really know what this is yet, I'm going to start with a web server and
some WebSockets and the basis of an idea. Then I'm going to get some scorpion
bowls, and hope the Ballmer Peak does the rest.

## Follow up

Totally missed the Ballmer Peak, was conviced code should have been in English
and not Go, got frustrated and passed out on couch. 

## Update

Ate lots of greasy breakfast foods, hangover successfully quelled. I think I've
written code things, but I have no guarantee that anything does literally
anything at all.
